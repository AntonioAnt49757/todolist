This is a to-do website that starts with three default to-do lists: My Day, Work, and Personal. Users can also create additional custom lists. Tasks can be organized based on their status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed) and priority (Low, Medium, High).

The website includes a feature to download a PDF containing the tasks. Additionally, it uses two APIs:

GeoNames API (http://api.geonames.org/getJSON):
Used to fetch geographical data (e.g., details about a specific city) based on a cityId.
OpenWeatherMap API (http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather):
Used to retrieve weather information for a given location using its latitude (lat) and longitude (lng).
These APIs enhance the app by potentially associating geographical or weather data with tasks or lists.
